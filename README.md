# SpyGlass-FinancialGoalApp
Hello readers, this repository represents a group project I've completed with companions in a program over the summer. This application is called SpyGlass, and its purpose is to serve as a financial goal tracker for users. Users can have their own list of financial goals, like say buying a house, and provide specifications like savings goal, how much they are saving on a timely basis, etc.
